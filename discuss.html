      <h1>Is Cloud Computing secure from data breach?</h1>
      <p>Data breach is an incident that has potential to disclose sensitive information to an unauthorized party. Data breaches may be caused by a variety of reasons such as theft. In the era of cloud computing, data breaches is one of the major security concerns found in the literature. There were plenty of incidents of this kind in the history of computing and of late the cloud computing. Since cloud computing is the technology that delivers on-demand services pertaining to infrastructure, software and platforms, it is vulnerable various kinds of data breaches. Unless there is assurance to have security mechanisms in place, data owners express security concerns to outsource their data to public cloud. Though cloud service providers are striving to ensure protection of data of their customers, there were sufficient incidents related to data breaches that caused trouble to most reputed companies as well. Keeping the importance of this in mind, in this paper, we make a review of literature on the data breaches in cloud computing. Then we proposed a methodology for end to end secure communications through encryption. The proposed method does not allow an adversary to gain any meaning from stolen information as the content is encrypted and needs security credentials. The method is compared with other schemes found in the literature. The results revealed that the proposed method is better than other state-of-the-art schemes.</p>

        <h2>Cost</h2>
        <p>Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.</p>
        <h2>Global scale</h2>
        <p>The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when they’re needed, and from the right geographic location.</p>
        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.</p>

      <div class="cllft">
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.</p>
        <h2>Speed</h2>  
        <p>Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.</p>
        <h2>Productivity</h2>
        <p>On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.</p>

          <td>Cost saving
            <br>Cost saving is one of the biggest Cloud Computing benefits. It helps you to save substantial capital cost as it does not need any physical hardware investments. Also, you do not need trained personnel to maintain the hardware. The buying and managing of equipment is done by the cloud service provider.
          </td>
          <td>Risk of data confidentiality
          <br>There is always a risk that user data can be accessed by other people. So data and cloud protection must be good because if it won’t be dangerous for data confidentiality.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>High Speed
          <br>Cloud computing allows you to deploy your service quickly in fewer clicks. This faster deployment allows you to get the resources required for your system within fewer minutes.</td>
          <td>Depends on internet connection
            <br>The internet is the only way to cloud computing. When there is no internet connection in your place, or the internet path to the cloud provider is in trouble, automatically access to your cloud computing machine will be disconnected. Now this is where the biggest obstacle is happening in developing countries and remote areas that do not have good internet access.And the weakness of public cloud is where everyone accesses the same server and server and will increase the risk of attack, and down the server.

          <td>Mobility
          <br>Employees who are working on the premises or at the remote locations can easily access all the could services. All they need is an Internet connectivity.
          </td>
          <td>The level of security
            <br>Secrecy and security are among the most doubtful things in cloud computing. By using a cloud computing system means we are fully entrusted with the security and confidentiality of data to companies that provide cloud computing servers. When you experience a problem, you cannot sue the server for errors in the data. When you experience a problem, you cannot sue the server for errors in the data</td>
